Hello Monalisa
==============

Hi there, it is your first time here, don't forget to leave us a star if you find this useful.

The example script is found `here <https://github.com/MattechLab/monalisa/blob/main/examples/imDim_plus_card/script.m>`_ and can be run as soon as the compilation step is done. Use it to test out our reconstruction framework. There, for simplicity, we assume the mitosis step was already performed.

If you are here, you are probably considering our framework for image reconstruction. Please be aware that you need to acquire a prescan for coil sensitivity estimation to be able to use this framework. To be able to run reconstruction on your custom data, please refer to the complete documentation.
