Hello Monalisa
==============

Hi there, it is your first time here, don't forget to leave us a star if you find this useful.

The example script is found `here <https://github.com/MattechLab/monalisa/blob/main/examples/imDim_plus_card/script.m>`_ and can be run 
as soon as the compilation step is done. Use it to test out our reconstruction framework. There, for simplicity, we provide some prepared data
that you can directly give as argument to our reconstruction functions. 

If you are here, you are probably considering our framework for image reconstruction. 
Please be aware that you need a coil sensitivity estimation to run our iterative reconstructions. You can estimate the 
coil sensitivities either with your own method, or with our method (see documentation). But the second alternative makes use of some 
prescan data that you have either to acquire yourself, or that you may found in your raw-data file.
