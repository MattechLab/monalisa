Third Example: Respiratory Binning for Motion-Resolved Cardiac MRI using Superior-Inferior (SI) Projections
===========================================================================================================

The present respiratory binning procedure is implemented in the script `lineMask_resp_fromSI_script.m`. 
It returns a list of masks (one mask per bin) as a binary array of size `[nBin, nLines]` where `nLines` is 
the total number of acquired lines in the sequence.

Each mask corresponds to a respiratory phase extracted from the superior inferior (SI) projections 
acquired as the first line of each shot of a 3D-radial free running sequence [1]_. 

In order to run the scripts, the SIâ€™s must be prepared in an array named `SI` of size `[nCh, N, nShot]` 
where `nCh` is the number of channels in the raw data, `N` is the number of points per acquired line, 
and `nShot` is the total number of shots acquired during the sequence. We describe here 
each section of the script. 


Steps for Respiratory Binning using SI projections:
---------------------------------------------------


1. **Initialization**


   Here we set some parameters to help the program to recognize correct sizes 
   and to inform the rest of the procedure. Enter the requested parameters 
   as described more in detail below. You can then run the section. 

   .. code-block:: matlab
      
      %% Initialization
      
      filter_type                 = 'lowPass';    
                                    % 'lowPass'  for respiratory binning

      nMask                       = 4; 
      maskWidth                   = 1; % a with of 1 expresses no overlap. 
      nSignal_to_select           = 1; % 1 manually, untrended, 
                                       % selected signal for resp. 
                                       % binning 

      signal_exploration_level    = 'medium';     
                                    % 'leight' or 'medium' 
                                    % or 'heavy'

      nCh                         = 20; 
      N                           = 384; 
      nSeg                        = 22; 
      nShot                       = 3870;

      nLine                       = nSeg*nShot; 
      nPt                         = N*nLine; 



   -	`filter_type` must be set to `lowPass` for respiratory binning. 
   -	`nMask` is the number of masks (or bins) that we want in the output. 
   -	`maskWidth` expresses how much the bins can overlap between neighbors. A value of 1 expresses no overlap. A value of 1.2 expresses 20% overlap. 
   -	`signal_exploration_level` is irrelevant for respiratory binning. It is needed for cardiac binning.   
   -	`nCh` is the number of channels in the raw data. 
   -	`N` is the number of points per acquired lines. 
   -	`nSeg` is the number of segments per shot in the sequence. 
   -	`nShot` is the total number of acquired shots in the sequence. 



2. **Constructing root-mean-squared SI for display** 

   This section requires no input. 
   It is just evaluating the root-mean-squared SI's for a display purpose. 
   You can just run the section. 

   .. code-block:: matlab
      
      %% getting rmsSI from SI
      
      rmsSI = bmMriPhi_fromSI_rmsSI(SI, nCh, N, nShot); 



3. **Extracting one single Reference Signal for Respiratory Binning** 

   The goal of this section is to extract a single reference physiological 
   signal that will serve to perform the respiratory binning. 

   .. code-block:: matlab

      %% getting standart_reference_signal from SI

      [s_ref, ...
      t_ref, ...
      Fs_ref, ...
      nu_ref, ...
      imNav, ...
      ind_shot_min, ...
      ind_shot_max, ...
      ind_SI_min, ...
      ind_SI_max, ...
      s_reverse_flag   ] =... 
      bmMriPhi_fromSI_get_standart_reference_signal(rmsSI, ...
                                                    nCh, ...
                                                    N, ...
                                                    nSeg, ...
                                                    nShot); 
   
   Run the section and you will see a graphical interface appear. 
   You should be able to recognize the respiratory pattern. 

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/ref_signal_1.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: Graphical Interface to Select the Reference Signal


   You need now to define 3 pairs of lines by 6 clicks (and some possible re-adjustments) 
   and then close the window to terminate the section.


   The first pair of lines is to define a horizontal window. 

      - Do `s + Left Click` to set the left end of the window.
      - Do `s + Right Click` to set the right end of the window.

   The program is going to construct internally the even extension 
   of the reference signal extracted by the present section. Observe 
   next figure to select the left and right end of the horizontal 
   window so that no pathology occurs, if possible (it is not critical 
   but do your best). 
   
   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/even_extension.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: Even Extension and Associated Pathologies
   
   In order to avoid pathologies in the even extension of the reference signal, 
   we will select the left and right ends (yellow vertical bars) of the 
   horizontal window either in two maxima of the respiratory pattern, or in two minima.
   You can zoom with the loop to click precisely.  
   
   Note that the left end of that horizontal window also serve to exclude the 
   non-steady-state data lines.

   Here is an example of the selection for the left and right ends of the horizontal
   window. 

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/left_end.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: Left end of horiozntal window


   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/right_end.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: Right end of horiozntal window


   You have now to define the lower and upper bound of the vertical window that
   contains some characteristic pattern of respiration. The best way to do it
   is to select some vertical window that seems to contain some respiratory pattern
   and then adjust it as described below. Make two clicks as follows: 

      - Do `x + Left Click` to set the lower bound of the window.
      - Do `x + Right Click` to set the upper end of the window.

   After the first click you shou see something like this: 

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/lower_bound.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: Lower bound vertical window


   And after the second click you shou see something like that: 

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/upper_bound.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: Upper bound vertical window
    
   The red line is the reference signal generated from the selected windows. 
   It is a weighted average of the grey values in the vertical window. 
   You have now to adjust it: 

      - press the up-arrow to shift the vertical window up, 
      - press the down-arrow to shift the vertical window down,
      - press the ctrl+right-arrow to increase the width of vertical window,
      - press the ctrl+left-arrow to decrease the width of vertical window,

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/ref_signal_2.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: ref_signal_2
   
   You can also 

      - press ctrl+up-arrow to increase the displayed amplitude of the reference signal,
      - press ctrl+down-arrow to decrease the displayed amplitude of the reference signal.
      - press ctrl+R to flip up-down the reference signal. 

   After playing with those adjustments, you may be able to end up with something 
   similar like the next figure.  
      
   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/ref_signal_3.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: ref_signal_3


   Finally, chose a vertical window that will serve for display purpose 
   only in the rest of the procedure.

      - press n + left-click to select the lower bound of the display window, 
      - press n + right-click to select the upper bound of the display window. 


   After the first click you shou see something like this: 

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/ref_signal_4.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: ref_signal_4


   And after the second click you shou see something like that: 

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/ref_signal_5.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: ref_signal_5  


   You can now close the window and the chosen reference signal will
   automatically be saved. 



4. **Graphical Frequency Selector**

   We will now lowpass filter the reference signal. Run the following section.  

   .. code-block:: matlab

      %% graphical frequency selector
      
      [ s_ref_lowPass, ...
      s_ref_bandPass, ...
      lowPass_filter, ...
      bandPass_filter ] = ...
      bmMriPhi_graphical_frequency_selector(s_ref, ...
                                            t_ref, ...
                                            Fs_ref, ...
                                            nu_ref, ...
                                            imNav); 
                                                               

   You should then see the graphical frequency selector appear. In the left panel is the 
   frequency spectrum of the reference signal displayed, and the right panel 
   is the reference signal displayed.  
   On the left panel, in the upper line of buttons, press the more right button the stretch 
   the frequency axis to the right until you see a similar picture like the following.  

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/freq_select_1.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: freq_select_1  

   Still on the left panel, in the lower line of buttons, on the right, press the "<<<" button
   to decrease the value of the maximum frequency of the filter. You may have to press many times 
   until the effect appears on the displayed range of frequencies. You can also use the buttons 
   "<<" and "<" to be more precise. Try to identify the peak around the base frequency of 
   the respiratory signal, and create a lowpass filter that include that peak, like on the 
   following figure. 

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/freq_select_2.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: freq_select_2  


   For respiratory binning, keep the minimum frequency of the filter at 0. We do a lowpass 
   filter (bandpass will be for cardiac binning). 
   
   Then press the button "Filter Signal". 
   The filtered signal appears then in blue on the right panel. 
   You can press "Hide Yelow" to discard the reference signal. 
   
   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/freq_select_3.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: freq_select_3  
   
   
   You can stretch the time axis in both directions using the "<<<" and ">>>" buttons  
   and navigate using the "--->" and  "<---" buttons to inspect the filtered 
   reference signal. Make sure that the signal looks like a sinusoid modulated in 
   amplitude and frequency, but that no harmonic of the base frequency are expressed. 
   There should ideally be no ringing in the filtered signal.   


     .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/freq_select_4.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: freq_select_4  


   If needed, you can re-adjust the filter and press "Filter Signal" again, 
   until the filtered signal looks like a modulated sinusoid. You can then close
   window and the filter will be saved.

   Note that you can change the contrast of the background in the right 
   panel with the imcontrast tool of Matlab by pressing the "imcontrast" button. 
   But once you have changed the contrast, press the "fix contrast" button, else
   changes in contrast will be lost.  
 

5. **Reformatting the Filtered Signal**

   Just execute the following automatic section. 

   .. code-block:: matlab
      
      %% reformated_signal_ref
      check_image = rmsSI(ind_SI_min:ind_SI_max, :); 
      reformated_signal_ref = ...
      bmMriPhi_fromSI_standartSignal_to_reformatedSignal(s_ref_lowPass, ...
                                                         nSeg, ...
                                                         nShot, ...
                                                         ind_shot_min, ...
                                                         ind_shot_max, ...
                                                         check_image);
                                                                              

   A figure appears then to show the filtered signal reformatted with the correct size. 
   You can check on that figure that the filtered signal oscillate together with the 
   background. 

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/resp_confirm.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: resp_confirm  

   You can close that figure and go to the next section. 


6. **Looking for Signal Candidates in Order to Create a Phase**

   This section is important for cardiac binning. It has no effect for the present 
   respiratory binning. Just run it and go to the next. 

   .. code-block:: matlab
      
      %% extracting reformated_signal_list from SI 
      if nSignal_to_select > 1 
         nSignal_to_select_minus_1 = nSignal_to_select - 1; 
         reformated_signal_list = ...
         bmMriPhi_fromSI_collect_signal_list(filter_type, ...
                                             t_ref, ...
                                             nu_ref, ...
                                             SI, ...
                                             lowPass_filter, ...
                                             bandPass_filter, ...
                                             nCh, ...
                                             N, ...
                                             nSeg, ...
                                             nShot, ...
                                             nSignal_to_select_minus_1, ...
                                             signal_exploration_level, ...
                                             ind_shot_min, ...
                                             ind_shot_max, ...
                                             ind_SI_min, ...
                                             ind_SI_max, ...
                                             s_reverse_flag);
      else
         reformated_signal_list = []; 
      end

      reformated_signal_list = cat(1, ...
                                 reformated_signal_ref, ...
                                 reformated_signal_list); 




7. **Selecting the Best Candidate Signals**

   This section is to include and exclude candidate signals for cardiac binning. 
   In the present case of respiratory binning, we have only one candidate. 
   You can run section.   

   .. code-block:: matlab
      
      %% exclude some of the signals manually
      final_signal_list = ...
      bmMriPhi_manually_exclude_signal_of_list( reformated_signal_list ); 


   A figure appears to display our single candidate signal. Just close the figure. 
   

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/accept_resp.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: accept_resp 

   Then accept the signal, and go to the next section.

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/accept_refuse.png
      :width: 40%
      :align: center
      :alt: accept_refuse 
   


8. **Create the Masks**

   Here is the last section for respiratory binning. You can run it. 

   .. code-block:: matlab
      
      %% mask_construction
      rMask = bmMriPhi_magnitude_to_mask(final_signal_list, ...
                                         nMask, ...
                                         nSeg, ...
                                         nShot, ...
                                         ind_shot_min, ...
                                         ind_shot_max); 
                                          

   .. image:: ../images/respiratory_binning/resp_mask.png
      :width: 90%
      :align: center
      :alt: resp_mask 

   The binning mask are displayed and stored in the variable rMask. Note that
   some first lines are excuded by the masks, in accordance with the choice of the
   horizontal window, which was chosen to exclude non-steady state acquired lines
   at the beginning of the procedure. 

   You can then save rMask on the disk for a future purpose.
