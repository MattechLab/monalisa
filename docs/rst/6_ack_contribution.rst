The contributors behind Monalisa
================================
- Mauro Leidi: the architect of order. He designed the documentation structure and  contributed extensively to example tutorials, benchmark tests, along with key component code contributions.

- Bastien Milani: the brain of the project. He wrote the core codes and documentation for the toolkit. With this work, he significantly advanced the state of the art in Magnetic Resonance Imaging reconstruction through a sound mathematical reformulation - and implementation - of the functions. 

- Yiwei Jia: “let-me-code-that-for-you” (LMCTFY). Besides writing documentation and participating in code review and maintenance, she developed key examples and tutorials, empowering users and testers. 

- Jaime Barranco: one “git-savant” to rule them all. He developed documentation and actively participated in code and data maintenance, ensuring the toolkit\'s long-term usability.

- Dominik Helbing: tour guide of the codes. He authored the documentation, implemented part of the user interface (UI) components, and contributed to commenting on codes for clarity of the toolkit. 

- Jean-Baptiste Ledoux: renowned MRI tamer. He participated in the documentation for “Acquisition Guidelines for Prescans”: don\'t be fooled, with him very complex scanning procedures look trivial - but they are not. 

- Benedetta Franceschiello: injected lymphatic fluid to the system. Lab leader and Principal Investigator (PI), she mentored the team, proposed novel applications and benchmark tests, coordinated meetings, ensured legal and financial support, and dedicated countless hours to ensuring the success of this project.
