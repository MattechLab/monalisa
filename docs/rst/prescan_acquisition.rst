Acquisition Guidelines for Coil Sensitivity Estimation using Prescans
=======================================================================

We recommend using prescans for accurate coil sensitivity estimation. Our method requires two small extra acquisitions that are quick to perform.

Consider the following when acquiring prescans:

1. One prescan should be performed with the body coil, while the second should be performed with the same coils used for the main acquisition.
2. The Field of View (FOV) of the prescans should match that of the main acquisition.
3. Use a small repetition time (TR), as image contrast is not necessary.
4. The flip angle should be small (e.g., 5 degrees).
